                                                      First Project "CarRacing"

The carracing-v0 environment is a very simple problem similar to a tracking car. Our goal is to control the car to run in the track and to dash forward as fast as possible. The environment gives us the continuous control task, which requires us to learn from the pixels obtained from the top view.


The state includes the actual speed of the car, four ABS sensors, the position of the steering wheel and the gyroscope. The action includes the control of steer, gas and brake.

The reward is computed by the tiles that the car passed.



                                                      Second Project "BipedalWalker robot"

A bipedal robot Bipedal (with 2 legs) robots to be able to walk efficiently using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm.

We propose a minor alteration to the OpenAI Gym framework, where we parameterize parts of an environment and allow an agent to jointly learn to modify these environment parameters along with its policy. We demonstrate that an agent can learn a better structure of its body that is not only better suited for the task, but also facilitates policy learning.

Joint learning of policy and structure may even uncover design principles that are useful for assisted-design applications.
