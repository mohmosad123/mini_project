# mini_project

The carracing-v0 environment is a very simple problem similar to a tracking car. Our goal is to control the car to run in the track and to dash forward as fast as possible. The environment gives us the continuous control task, which requires us to learn from the pixels obtained from the top view.


The state includes the actual speed of the car, four ABS sensors, the position of the steering wheel and the gyroscope. The action includes the control of steer, gas and brake.

The reward is computed by the tiles that the car passed.
